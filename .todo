Scraper (conditions):
    Conditional crawling
    Distribute
        Randomised IP
        Download html
    Return html

Parser (html):
    Remove scripts and styles
    Merge nested DOM containers
    Keep existing tables
    Remove non english identifiers
    Store in a well defined schema
    Return parsed

Information Extraction & Retrieval(parsed html, query):
    Parse query
    Understand query:
        Synonyms
        Match with world knowledge
        Reduce query to a minimal representation Q
        Generate output format schema S from query
    
    Convert keys in parsed html to a minimal representation K

    Analyse:
        Scan any synonyms exist in the Q and K and mark it
        Deduce patterns from known output and compare with the parsed html
        Compare the keys with world knowledge
        Scan the full parsed html for Q with world knowledge
    Output:
        Convert data to schema S
        Convert to given file format/stream
        Return file/stream
